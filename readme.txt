HOW TO PLAY
It's probably best just read how Quantum League played.  This game has both asynchronous and turn-based gameplay (depending on the setting).


CURRENT STATE
It all seems to work, but it's very unpolished.  And the arena could do with rearranging.


DEV NOTES
The file Globals.gd has various settings which you can change.
